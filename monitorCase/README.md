# Monitor Case For Chromebook Screen ( WIP )

Project to turn an 11.6 inch screen from a chromebook into an external monitor

Parts list:
- [Samsung Chromebook 2](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/chromebook-2) Screen  
- LCD Controller Board [Amazon $26.68](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XC6SJF7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)


I assume [this screen](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/chromebook-2) could work as it is compatible with the board and looks like the screw holes would line up the same
