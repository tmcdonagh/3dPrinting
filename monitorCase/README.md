# Monitor Case For Chromebook Screen ( WIP )

Project to turn an 11.6 inch screen from a chromebook into an external monitor

Parts list:
- [Samsung Chromebook 2](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/chromebook-2) Screen  
- LCD Controller Board [Amazon $26.68](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XC6SJF7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- M2.5 Thread Screws ( I use [these](http://adafru.it/3299) )


I assume [this screen](https://www.amazon.com/CHROMEBOOK-SUBSTITUTE-REPLACEMENT-XE500C12-K01US-B116XTN01-0/dp/B0169N5150/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1447688140&sr=1-1&keywords=chromebook+replacement+screen+xe500c12-k01us) could work as it is compatible with the board and looks like the screw holes would line up the same
